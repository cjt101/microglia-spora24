Data and Jupyter Notebook related to sensing can be found in the sensing folder. Data and Jupyter Notebook related to temperature and phagocytosis without sensing can be found in temp-and-phagocytosis.

Please note that the original Excel sheets contain some edits during preliminary research. However, the original data that was outputted by BehaviorSpace is intact, and is contained within the first several rows of each Excel sheet.

Additionally, some Excel sheets have an extra column titled "initial-number-ab-plaque". The variable this was associated to did *not* affect the output of BehvaiorSpace, as the initial number of these agents were 0 for all experiments. This column is a leftover of a previous feature of our model that was later removed, which represented amyloid-beta plaques within the hippocampus.
